[00:18.12] Rainy day, go far away i'm tired of blues i've gone through.
[00:34.22] Lonely nights, eight thousand sights, of times I once knew.
[00:54.20] Go away, you rainy day, far away; out of my mind.
[01:08.69] I should've known when times, they got hard, you'd go and steal away.
[02:04.86] The cards broke right, you're out of sight, and so I named you rainy day.
[02:22.76] Transparent trees, not what they seem, float by in shades of gray.
[02:40.04] Dusty shadows dancing 'round in my brain, yeah their name is 'rainy day'.
[02:57.21] Rainy day, go far away, I'm tired of blues...(i've gone through)
