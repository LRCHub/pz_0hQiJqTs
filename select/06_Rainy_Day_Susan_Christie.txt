Rainy day, go far away i'm tired of blues i've gone through.
Lonely nights, eight thousand sights, of times I once knew.
Go away, you rainy day, far away; out of my mind.
I should've known when times, they got hard, you'd go and steal away.
The cards broke right, you're out of sight, and so I named you rainy day.
Transparent trees, not what they seem, float by in shades of gray.
Dusty shadows dancing 'round in my brain, yeah their name is 'rainy day'.
Rainy day, go far away, I'm tired of blues...(i've gone through)
