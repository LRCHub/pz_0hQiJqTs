How many tears now darling
Must a man let fall?
And how many years will it take
To forgive me for it all?

You see when I took you for granted
I knew not just what I had done
But I was a fool not to see
That you were the perfect one

I've made some wrong moves
That I won't deny
Went looking for love
When it was right before my eyes

Now don't you come and tell me
That you've found somebody new
'Cause I know it's gonna hurt me
More than I could ever hurt you

And I'm gonna cry like a rainy day
It's just that I
I don't want to see a good thing slip away

Late at night, that's when I hope and pray
That these lonely tears
Will wash my pain away
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry, cry
Like a rainy day

Well I'm gonna get it together
I'm gonna try to make you understand
Put it all down in a letter
Oh, and tell you about this brand new man

Remember these arms
How they held you in
But girl, mark my words
It's gonna be that way again

Now give me one more chance
I swear to God I'll be true
But don't you walk away now
I'll never make it without you

And I'm gonna cry like a rainy day
It's just that I
I don't want to see a good thing slip away

Late at night, well that's when I hope and pray
That these lonely tears
Will wash my pain away
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry, cry, yeah
Like a rainy day
I'm gonna cry
